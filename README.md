# Alignment-Keys
Create a LocalScript within your Roblox game under StarterPlayer -> StarterPlayerScripts and paste the code from "source.lua" into that script to implement this fix.

This brings back the old functionality of the Comma, Period, PageUp, and PageDown keys, allowing you to use them to manipulate your camera like you could before roblox removed this feature. Mainly used in obby games.
