# Alignment-Keys
Not sure why roblox removed this in the first place.. One of the most useful features, especially for obby games

## Directions
Option 1: Create a LocalScript in your Roblox Studio Explorer under StarterPlayer -> StarterPlayerScripts and paste the code from "source.lua" into the editor

Option 2: Download and drag the "AlignmentKeys.rbxm" file into Roblox Studio and drag the LocalScript (usually automatically inserted into the Workspace) into StarterPlayer -> StarterPlayerScripts

## Information
Brings back the old functionality of the Comma, Period, PageUp, and PageDown keys, allowing you to use them to manipulate your camera identically to how you could before roblox removed this feature
